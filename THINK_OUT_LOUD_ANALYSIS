The vision for the game is excellent.
The autonomy of the scope design and jitter is good.
It lacks background.
It lacks a way to 'win' currently.
It lacks a Map/interactive enviroment to play in. 
It lacks a points system.
The tracking method of the crosshair was praised by everyone who played. 
Need the shooting to be implemented through the scope, with visual feedback to the user that indicates the shot has been taken.
