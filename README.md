TASKS TO IMPLEMENT 

Hard mode - Randomised/ toggle at the start of gameplay/ continously gets harder over duration of game play

Ways it can get harder - objects can begin to fall from the sky which can damage the player, multiple scopes can begin targeting the player, npcs may appear that target the player. 

Lives system/Score system? 

Background and colors - stickman can be redesigned. 

Crosshair should be more unpredicate - darting around/sticking to the player more as time goes on and the game gets harder.
