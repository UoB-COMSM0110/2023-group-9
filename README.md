TASKS TO IMPLEMENT 

Hard mode - Randomised/ toggle at the start of gameplay/ continously gets harder over duration of game play

Ways it can get harder - objects can begin to fall from the sky which can damage the player, multiple scopes can begin targeting the player, npcs may appear that target the player. 

Lives system/Score system? 

Background and colors - stickman can be redesigned. 

Crosshair should be more unpredicate - darting around/sticking to the player more as time goes on and the game gets harder. 

Add more convincing physics, jumping that can be moved when the p

Bricks, Walls, other structures that you have to hide behind - if he shoots the bricks or a 'button' that you are behind a bridge appears or blocks or something that allows you to progress through the map, such a crossing an unjumpable gap. 


--Notes for report
- Had to overcome the issue of using an image - rewrote code so that the stickman was an object we could modify. 
- Small communication issues at start of project, used git readme/groupchat to communicate better afterrwards.
